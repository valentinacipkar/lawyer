                                        Abortion is illegal in Cyprus up to the 
                                        extent of a 14 years prison sentence except 
                                        under certain narrowed exceptions. Nevertheless, 
                                        European Union Law considers abortion as a ‘Service’ 
                                        and most of the EU Member States have sufficiently 
                                        more relaxed access to abortion services than Cyprus 
                                        currently does. Taken as granted that EU Law explicitly 
                                        overrides Cyprus national law, even on the criminalisation 
                                        of abortion, it follows that any Cypriot woman can vindicate
                                        her access to abortion, through the EU principle of freedom of
                                        services. This is in relation not only in establishing access
                                        to abortion, but also in claiming refund for up to
                                        the total costs that occurred to the Cyprus woman
                                        by being forced to travel to another Member State 
                                        in fulfilling such task.
